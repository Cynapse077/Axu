-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Mouse movement on world map - mouse cursor offset is wrong.
- Blood slime familiar.
- Hire NPCs to stay at your base to sell goods, provide medical services, etc.
- Spawn enemies based on level via blueprint grouping. Sort similar ones by level. Quite like how Fallout 4 or Skyrim does it, but not to that extent.
	- Just to make sure you don't run into the same group of low-level Bandits later in the game.

CYBERNETICS:
- One per body slot.
	- Folding blade that takes up arm and weapon slot. - Equip to arm, and will unequip weapon, and set wep to itself. - or set default limb to folded blade? But only for one arm..?
	- Increased vision at night.
	- Radiation scrubber.
	- Impact soles for extra stealth.
