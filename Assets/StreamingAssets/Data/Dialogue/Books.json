Not only that, but I can feel my body slowly stiffening. Whether it's from the cold, or some residual effect from the crystal's energy, I have no idea. I'm slowly making my way back. Just know that I'm alive.\n\n    P.S. Your brother still owes me money. He has until I'm back to get it together. I'm serious this time.\n\n- Wes\""
