Not only that, but I can feel my body slowly stiffening. Whether it's from the cold, or some residual effect from the crystal's energy, I have no idea. I'm slowly making my way back. Just know that I'm alive.\n\n    P.S. Your brother still owes me money. He has until I'm back to get it together. I'm serious this time.\n\n- Wes\""

		"Text" : "Yoabos, our home for millions of years. As a species, we were so awful to her. We dug into and built on top of her flesh to sate our lust to leave an imprint. Between the scars, there was an indescribable beauty. A warmth. She gave us life, and we tore her to shreds. I still recall gazing out of my parents' window, watching the rains cascading down. The pitter-patter of the drops relieving any tension in the world. That was before I was taken. At twelve years old, I was put into cryosleep and forced to board a ship. One that would eventually take me to Axu. Apparently, my parents had died in a riot of some kind. I know not the details, only that a \"liability\" such as myself was considered as bad as the criminals I now call my kin."
